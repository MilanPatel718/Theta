		<p style="color: red;">
			Sigma Beta Rho was established at Rutgers University, New Brunswick in 1998 by Mr. Kashyap Parikh, Founding Father Absolut. By 2001 we reached chapter status becoming the eighth chapter of Sigma Beta Rho, the Theta Chapter. 
		</p> 
		<p style="color: black;">
			Mr. Parikh had a vision to bring a Fraternity to Rutgers University that would enhance the collegiate experience, provide a lifetime of opportunity, and also foster leadership in an individual. Above all this, however, remained the core motto of Sigma Beta Rho: <strong><em>"Brotherhood Beyond All Barriers"</em></strong>.
		</p>
		<p style="color: green;">
			Nearly 20 years later this vision still echoes in the minds of all the brothers as they strive to uphold the values of this Fraternity. With a nationwide alumni network of over 2000 brothers and an alumni network at Theta Chapter of over 100 brothers, Sigma Beta Rho truly is the fastest growing nationwide multicultural fraternity.

<div class="Pic-Descrip" style="color: white;  ">
	<h1 style="color: red"> Society </h1>
	<p style="color: green;"> 
		The ideal Society refers to the community in which one lives. Sigma Beta Rho fosters the belief that individuals have a responsibility to the society to which they belong. It is one's duty as a brother to give back to one's family, community, and fraternity that which an individual has to offer to the ideal of service.
	</p>

	<h1 style="color: red"> Brotherhood </h1>
	<p style="color: green;">
		The invincible bond that is shared between the members of this fraternity. This bond is symbolized by the word "Qurbani" which is the Hindi translation of the word "Sacrifice". Qurbani represents the strength of our brotherhood and our unity as a Fraternity.
	</p>
	<h1 style="color: red"> Remembrance </h1>
	<p style="color: green;">
		At a time when many individuals share a birthplace different from that of their ancestors, it is necessary for an individual to recognize and appreciate his culture. Sigma Beta Rho not only encourages its members to appreciate their own culture, but also to gain an awareness of other cultures.

		<p>
			Sigma Beta Rho prides itself on its first pillar, Society, and as such we have chosen S.O.S Children's Villages as our national philanthrophy.
		</p>
		<p>  S.O.S. Children's Villages International has been working with disadvantaged families around the world (over 133 different countries) since 1960 in order to prevent crises that can lead to family separation. The focus is on abandoned, destitute and orphaned children requiring family-based child care. Millions of children worldwide are living without their biological families therefore S.O.S. provides about 50,000 such children and 15,000 young adults with a permanent new family, with a '24 hours a day'new S.O.S. mother to provide family-based care.
