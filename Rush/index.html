	 				<h1>Greek Life at Rutgers</h1>
	 				<p>
	 					Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey at New brunswick, is a large school spread across four campuses. As a result, Greek Life at Rutgers is also very large with over 80 different Greek Organizations on campus. Sigma Beta Rho is proud to be one of these organizations and values its role in the greater greek community.

	 					As a student at Rutgers University, the sheer size of the school and number of different organizations to join can be very overwhelming. In turn, Sigma Beta Rho strives to remain a multifaceted organization that can offer the most to collegiate men. Joining Sigma Beta Rho can install positive values, provide an avenue for leadership, and stress self-betterment. Our strength as a fraternity is tied directly to the upholding of our pillars Society, Brotherhood, and Remembrance.

	 					When you join Sigma Beta Rho you aren't just joining a fraternity for the duration of college, but rather you are joining a nationwide brotherhood for life.

The Theta Chapter has had a role in helping start up the organization at all these schools and know that we will only continue to grow.  
	 				</p>
	 				<p>
	 					It is one of the greatest achievements that Sigma Beta Rho can be found at schools all around the country, but it is an even greater achievement that the strength of our second pillar, brotherhood, resonates equally within all these schools. No matter where you travel you can be assured that there is most likely a brother nearby ready to show you hospitality. With a nationwide listserv, multiple regional conferences, and biennial national conventions you can be sure that your social and professional networks will expand significantly after joining Sigma Beta Rho.

				 	     <h2>What is "Rush"</h2>
						<p>Rush is a period where we share what our fraternity has to offer its members. Through Rush, we hope to recruit potential new brothers who support our values and share our visions of making an impact in our school and communities. We have arranged several events that give rushes an opportunity to meet the current members and learn more about the brotherhood. There is absolutely no commitment to join and best of all, the events are FREE!</p>
                       
                       <h2>What is new member education and how long will it take?</h2>
                       <p>More than anything else, new member education is a learning period. During this period, a potential new member gets educated about the values and ideals of Sigma Beta Rho and its history and traditions. Most importantly, during this period all aspirants get acquainted with the brothers of the fraternity and vice versa. A new member educator is assigned to each new member class who will lead the new member class through this learning process. The new member educator will be interacting with the aspirants very closely during this period and would act as the judge of the successful completion of new member education program.</p>

                       <h2>What is required of a new member to begin/complete new member education? </h2>
                       <p> Sigma Beta Rho strives to promote academic excellence amongst its members. Therefore, potential new members must not only meet the Rutgers minimum GPA of a 2.5 but also our standard of a 3.0 in order to be eligible for a bid. Rutgers also mandates that first semester freshmen are ineligible to recieve a bid (however they are still allowed to rush). In order to complete the new member education process, a potential new member must maintain a high level of academics. In addition, they must show a level of commitment to learning the values and ideals of Sigma Beta Rho which, outside of what is required for the NME process, includes meeting a set amount of Community Service/Philanthropic hours. Only if and when a potential new member meets these criteria can they be considered for induction.
                       
                       <h2>What does it mean/how much will it cost to become a new member</h2>
                  <p>Sigma Beta Rho does not charge a fee to participate in the new member education program. However, new member education program might require you to purchase certain materials that would be needed during the new member education period. These materials are affordable by average college students. After a potential new member is inducted they can expect to pay semesterly dues in the order of $150-250. Paying these dues allows an inducted brother the right to be active on campus. Membership expectations includes involvement in various events throughout the semester including rush, community service, philanthropy, social mixers, etc. In addition, one is required attend weekly chapter meetings.</p>

                       <h2>If I work or am taking classes, will I be able to have time for new member education?</h2>
                  <p>One of the major virtues of any successful individual is being able to manage his or her time most efficiently. Efficient time management is one of the key elements stressed during the new member education period. We understand that many people have obligations besides the fraternity. We honor those obligations and will make every attempt to accommodate your schedule. However, it is for you to decide if you want to manage your time efficiently. You will find that Sigma Beta Rho is very flexible with respect to school work and/or jobs but an individual student must show a willingness to work that much harder if they have a packed schedule.</p>
                       
                       <h2>Will my grades drop if I take part in New Member Education?</h2>
                  <p>As mentioned earlier, Sigma Beta Rho strives to promote academic excellence. Our scholarship chair works closely with potential new members throughout the semester and monitors grades frequently. New Member Education can be considred roughly the time equivalent of taking a 3 credit course at Rutgers. The New Member Education program mandates study hours for every aspirant without an exception. Ultimately, how one time manages will dicate whether or not their grades drop during the new member education process.</p>

                  <h2>Will I be forced to drink?</h2>
                  <p>As per our national Risk Management Policy, "All Members of Sigma Beta Rho Fraternity, Inc. shall abide by all applicable liquor control laws of the State or other jurisdiction including Colleges and Universities while participating in a Fraternity event". On top of this, section 5 of that same policy strictly prohibits the prescence of alcohol at any new member event. In short, alcohol is in no way related to the new member education process.</p>

                  <h2>Will I be hazed?</h2>
                  <p>No hazing whatsoever will take place during the new member education process. Our national Risk Management Policy strictly outlines that hazing of any form (physical, mental, etc.) is prohibited. Prohibited acts include, but are not limited to, "pre-initiaion activities that cause physical/mental fatigue, verbal abuse, activities outside the realm of enhacning a persons knowledge/professional intent, and various physical acts that dehumanize an individual". The full Risk Management Policy can be found at the bottom of the page. </p>
